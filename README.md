# Solar System Simulation

This project is a solar system simulation created for an assignment, aiming to showcase the dynamics and interactions of celestial objects within our solar system. The simulation includes several key celestial bodies orbiting around a central star (the Sun).

## Celestial Objects

### 1. Sun
- The central star of the solar system.
- Serves as the anchor and gravitational center around which other celestial objects orbit.

### 2. Earth
- A terrestrial planet orbiting around the Sun.
- Features its own rotation on its axis and an elliptical orbit around the Sun.

### 3. Moon
- A natural satellite orbiting around the Earth.
- Revolves around the Earth due to gravitational forces.

### 4. Asteroid
- An object orbiting around the Moon.
- Stuck in orbit around the Moon, demonstrating complex orbital dynamics.

### 5. Second Moon
- A different-sized moon-like object orbiting around the Earth.
- Rotates around the Earth at a unique speed and distance, adding diversity to the solar system model.

## Key Features

- **Asteroid Orbiting Moon**: Implemented to illustrate gravitational interactions and satellite dynamics within the solar system.
  
- **Second Moon Variation**: Added a secondary moon with distinct characteristics to showcase orbital diversity and complexity.

## Development Details

The solar system simulation likely involves the following concepts and technologies:

- **Physics Simulation**: Utilizing principles of celestial mechanics and orbital dynamics to model the behavior of celestial bodies.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementing each celestial object as a class or entity with specific attributes and behaviors.
  
- **Graphics and Visualization**: Potentially using graphical libraries or tools to visually represent the solar system with appropriate scales and distances.

## Future Enhancements

For further development and improvement of the solar system simulation:

- **Realistic Orbital Mechanics**: Refine orbital calculations to accurately simulate celestial motions based on known physical laws.
  
- **Interactive Features**: Implement user interactions to control or modify aspects of the solar system simulation.
  
- **Visual Enhancements**: Enhance the graphical representation with textures, shading, and realistic rendering techniques.

## Conclusion

This solar system simulation project is an educational and engaging endeavor to explore the dynamics of celestial bodies within our solar system. By incorporating diverse orbital configurations and interactions, the simulation offers insights into astronomy and planetary science.
